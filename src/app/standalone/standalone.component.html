    <h2 class="text-4xl">Angular 14, Standalone Component</h2>
    <p>Standalone components will, at last, be a feasible option, and Angular modules will no longer be required.

        A standalone component is not declared in any existing NgModule, and it directly manages its own dependencies
        (instead of having them managed by an NgModule) and can be depended upon directly, without the need for an
        intermediate NgModule.</p>
